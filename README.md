# SocializeMe 🎉  
*A responsive product splash page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.*

## 📍 Overview
This project was a Scrimba assignment to create a mobile-first product splash page, which I personalized by inventing **SocializeMe**, 
a high-energy meetup group for weekend fun. I customized the layout, colors, and imagery to create a bold, upbeat brand. 
Along the way, I practiced building responsive layouts with Flexbox, structured content with modifier classes, 
and styled an accessible sign-up form to match the design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 💡 What I Learned
- Mobile-first design and responsive layout techniques
- Using relative units and media queries for better scalability
- Structuring HTML with modifier classes (BEM-inspired)
- Styling forms to match brand identity
- Improving layout and user experience with Flexbox

## 🎨 What Was Fun
I actually had a riot coming up with the product idea and choosing the colors, logos, and images. 
I loved designing the product and the product page — this one was just fun!
